For parameters defining movement distribution, estimates may be drawn from either movement studies (e.g., step lengths), home range studies (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernal estimates), or expert opinion.  These parameter estimates should reflect expected movement during the sampling season only.  For some species (e.g., a wide-ranging species such as wolverine), an individual may be reasonably expected to potentially visit any location in its home range during the sampling season; however, this is not always expected to be the case.
